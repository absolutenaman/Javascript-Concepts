Callback hell, also known as the "pyramid of doom," is a common anti-pattern in JavaScript asynchronous programming. It arises when multiple asynchronous 
operations are chained together using nested callback functions, leading to deeply indented and difficult-to-read and maintain code.
How it occurs:-
When an asynchronous operation completes, it typically invokes a callback function to handle its result. If the next asynchronous operation depends on the result 
of the previous one, its callback function needs to be nested inside the first one. This nesting continues for each subsequent dependent operation, creating a pyramid-like 
structure of code.
Problems caused by callback hell:
Readability:-
The deep nesting makes the code hard to follow and understand the flow of execution.
Maintainability:-
Modifying or debugging the code becomes challenging due to its complex structure.
Error handling:-
Propagating errors through multiple nested callbacks can be cumbersome and error-prone.
Solutions to avoid callback hell:
Promises:-
Promises provide a cleaner and more structured way to handle asynchronous operations. They allow chaining of operations using .then() and .catch() methods, flattening the code structure.
Async/Await:-
Built on top of Promises, async/await syntax allows writing asynchronous code in a synchronous-like manner, further improving readability and maintainability.
Named functions:-
Breaking down complex callback functions into smaller, named functions can improve code organization and readability, even when using callbacks.
